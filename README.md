 Final group project code 301

##ARTQUEST-SEATTLE
 
 We have been asked by the Seattle Arts community to generate excitement and interest in Seattle's extensive collection of Public Art. Seattle has had a 1% for Arts since the 70s and the result is lots of interesting works of art scattered around the city. More recently, public works projects have incorporated public art into their new construction locations.

## Concept
 Increase awareness and interest in Seattle public art through gamification and social media*. Level up from Tourist Class to Expert by visiting Seattle's public arts and collecting points and awards along the way.  ​*Coming Soon!*​

### Scenarios
 New to Seattle or just visiting? Check out our website for a list of great public art you need to see to earn your tourist badge. Find works of art near you or choose a curated list to get started. As you visit each artwork, use your location to verify that you are in the right place.
 
 See your objectives on a map, or just show the ones you have completed.
 
 Create different quests based on location, number of art objects, and radius to quest in.
